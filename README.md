Diagnosis of Dermatological Diseases using 3D Projection
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an automated system for the diagnosis of dermatological diseases using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. By leveraging methods such as K-means clustering, morphology-based segmentation, CNNs, and 3D reconstruction, the system identifies unique patterns in skin images to aid in accurate and efficient disease detection.

The solution is designed to work even on resource-constrained devices like smartphones, making it particularly valuable for rural and developing regions where access to dermatologists is limited.

✨ Features

Image Acquisition & Preprocessing: Captures raw images, reduces noise, and enhances contrast.

Segmentation: Uses adaptive thresholding, edge detection, and clustering techniques to isolate diseased regions.

3D Reconstruction: Converts 2D dermatological images into 3D projections for better visualization.

Feature Extraction: Extracts texture and color characteristics to improve classification accuracy.

Classification: Employs CNNs and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for disease identification.

Lightweight Deployment: Optimized for smartphones with limited computational resources.
